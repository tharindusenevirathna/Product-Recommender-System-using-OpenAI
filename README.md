Product Recommendation System
<!-- Add an image related to your project, like a screenshot or a diagram -->

Project Overview
This project implements a personalized product recommendation system for GlimmerGate, an online shopping platform. The system leverages OpenAI's text embedding models to suggest new products to users based on their recently viewed items. By comparing the text embeddings of viewed products with the product database, the system recommends items that align with the user's preferences, enhancing engagement and customer satisfaction.

Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language
OpenAI API: For generating text embeddings
NumPy & Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing
Scikit-learn: For similarity calculations and PCA visualization
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization
Cosine Similarity: To compute similarity between products
Jupyter Notebook: For prototyping and development

Model Workflow
Data Preparation: Load and preprocess the product dataset, combining relevant information using Pandas.

Text Embedding: Use the OpenAI API to generate text embeddings for product titles and descriptions.

Similarity Analysis: Calculate cosine similarity between the embeddings of viewed products and the entire product database.

Recommendation Generation: Rank and suggest products with the highest similarity scores that the user hasn't viewed yet.

Key Features
Personalized Recommendations: Recommends products based on the user's recent product views.
Scalability: Can scale with an expanding product database.
Embedding Visualizations: Uses PCA for visualizing product embeddings and understanding product relationships.
Results
Provided accurate and relevant product recommendations based on similarity in product descriptions.
Visualized product embedding space using PCA, highlighting clusters and relationships between similar products.
